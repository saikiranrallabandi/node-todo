# saikiranlavanya

Minimal todo-list application, built with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Swagger](https://swagger.io/), [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) and [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/). And it runs within a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container.

This is my first Node.js application. Recruiters: Please don't look at it.

## Execution

Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running.

    docker-compose up --build

saikiranlavanya should now be running on [localhost:10010](http://localhost:10010/) and look like this:
